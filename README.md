Inside the "code" folder we have the following files:
	
	- 1D_tube.py - used to generate figure 4 of the report 
	- ex1_plots.py - used to generate figure 1 of the report 
	- ex2.py - used to generate Figure 5, 6, 7 ; also performs the linear fit
	- ex2_find_peaks.py - search the power spectrum for the peaks;
	- ex2_plot_photom.py used to generate Figure 8

	- first_ex.R - calculate the periodogram and smooth it with a Daniell kernel
	- first_ex_b.R - wavelet analysis of the sunspot data (Figure 3)	
	- plot_kernels.py - create Figure 2, from the outputs of first_ex.R
